I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.”</p><p>Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me.</p><p>“And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired.</p><p>Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks.</p><p>“I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster.</p><p>I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity.</p></div> </div>
