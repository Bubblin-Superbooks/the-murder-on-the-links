Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation.</p><p>Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld.</p><p>Léonie shook her head.</p><p>“She is terribly upset, <em>la pauvre dame</em>! She will eat nothing—but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, <em>par exemple</em>, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!”</p><p>Poirot nodded sympathetically.</p></div> </div>
