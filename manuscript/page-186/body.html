Renauld?”</p><p>“Over a year?”</p><p>“Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?”</p><p>“I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.”</p><p>“In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?”</p><p>“Absolutely.”</p><p>Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen.</p><p>Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud.</p><p>“My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.”</p></div> </div>
