I rather think he left me a thousand.”</p><p>“When was this will drawn up?”</p><p>“Oh, about a year and a half ago.”</p><p>“Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?”</p><p>Stonor was obviously very much surprised.</p></div> </div>
