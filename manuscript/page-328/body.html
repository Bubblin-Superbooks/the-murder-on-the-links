If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait.

He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him.</p><p>“Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?”</p><p>Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely:</p><p>“I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it. Of course Giraud is all wrong—wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not <em>because</em> of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.”</p></div> </div>
