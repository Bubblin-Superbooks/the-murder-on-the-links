There was less raillery in his voice as he asked:</p><p>“You believe, then, in birth and breeding?”</p><p>“I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class. It never answers.”</p><p>“I agree with you, <em>mon ami</em>. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.”</p><p>His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again her voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with <em>empressement</em>: “I will.”</p></div> </div>
